# IS601 - Mini Project 3 - Thankful Giving
Example Site: https://is601-mt85-td-f7d7f9bec981.herokuapp.com

### Objective/Project Description:
You'll be implementing a cross-organization Thanksgiving Drive application.
There will be CRUD operations to manage organizations and CRUD operations to manage donations related to organizations as well as an import page to preload given data.
Some files are provided as fully working and should not be modified, typically they'll have comments like "DO NOT EDIT".
Other files are basic skeleton files with a number of "TODO's" that you need to solve. It's best to make the code changes near where the particular TODO is (do not delete the TODO comments).
There are also provided test case files.
Between the TODOs and the tests you must implement the missing pieces to get all tests to pass for full credit.
Do not edit any of the test cases except for a caveat I'll mention in another paragraph below.
